          <h2>BharatPe founder asks for the removal of CEO from board</h2>
          <p>
            BharatPe co-founder and managing director Ashneer Grover has asked
            the board for the removal of chief executive Suhail Sameer from the
            board in the latest of a series of remarkable turn of events at the
            Tiger Global-backed Indian fintech startup.
          </p>
          <p>
            Grover, who is subject to an ongoing investigation whose preliminary
            finding has suggested fraud, wrote in a letter to board members on
            Wednesday for the removal of Sameer from the board, though he did
            not offer an explanation.
